    <p>A happy cloud. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic
      white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Let's build an almighty mountain.
      And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to
      plan it.</p>
    <p>The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. There are no limits in this world. We spend so much of our life
      looking - but never seeing.</p>
